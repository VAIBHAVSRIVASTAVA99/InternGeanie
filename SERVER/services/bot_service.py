                I'm excited to apply for the Data Annotation and Computer Vision internship at Inferigence Quotient Private Limited. As a Computer Science student with strong Python programming skills and hands-on experience with OpenCV and Linux, I believe I'm well-positioned to contribute effectively to your team.

                My experience includes developing several computer vision projects where I've worked extensively on data annotation, preprocessing, and model training. I've written Python scripts to automate data collection, implemented various preprocessing techniques to enhance image quality, and developed custom annotation tools to streamline the labeling process.

                I'm particularly passionate about computer vision applications and have experience in:
                - Implementing image processing algorithms using OpenCV
                - Developing annotation pipelines for object detection datasets
                - Converting between different annotation formats (COCO, Pascal VOC, YOLO)
                - Training and evaluating machine learning models on annotated datasets

                What excites me most about this internship is the opportunity to work on real-world computer vision problems while learning from experienced professionals in the field. The responsibilities outlined in the job description align perfectly with my technical skills and career goals.
